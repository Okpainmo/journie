# Journie

Journie is a simply amazing productivity app for note taking, scheduling and task
management, and journalling. It is a fullstack app built with the MERN stack and so
much more. It's a project I am excited about - especially considering the awesome
features that I hope to roll into subsequent versions of the app.
<br />
It comes with user accounts, authentication, and authorization, and a host of other
features. It's also live currently with a good number of sign ups.

## Live Site

Journie is live at [https://journie.vercel.app](https://journie.vercel.app)

## The build stack:

1. MER(NextJs)N
2. Tailwindcss
3. HeadlessUI
4. React hot toast – for notification pop-ups.
5. JWT and bcryptjs for authentication, authorization and password hashing.
6. Mongoose as ODM.
7. Axios.
8. AWS S3 – for file storage.
9. Multer for file uploads.
   and more...

I am currently inspired to build Journie into a high-productivity saas app. I’ll be highly encouraged to do that and proceed with the build if I get up to 500 sign-ups within the next 1 month.

I’ll even roll out a mobile version – if the user base grows to an encouraging extent.

Here are some exciting features that will roll-in in subsequent releases:

1. A very feature-rich todos/schedule functionality.
2. Markdown support.
3. A Journie WhatsApp chat-bot to follow up on created todos/schedules.
4. Entries grouping – a feature that gives users more organization by grouping the different types of entries(todos/schedules, notes, and journal entries) accordingly.
5. Todos grouping – the ability to add todos into groups – e.g. week plans.
6. Email notification feature – for sending official notifications to emails of people added as task/todo assignees.
7. An in-app email service that helps you send emails right from within the app.
8. Theme toggling between light and dark modes.

With maybe even more...
